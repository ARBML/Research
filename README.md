# Research
Support Arabic people working on research, industry and other fields by creating an environment for ideas in NLP and speech. 

## Motivation ? 
Many graduate students who are interested in Arabic research are not sure what to work on next ! The main purpose is to create some interesting ideas as an open creative enviroment for people how the research is evolving in Arabic NLP, speech and other fields. Moreover, pepople working on different fields and industry would like to explore and discuss how deep learning can be applied to different use cases. 

## Focus 
Our main interest is to help people who are working on Arabic NLP and speech. Moreover, we consider any intersection of Arabic and machine learning like Arabic art for example. 

## How it works ? 
We mainly divide the interest into four main categories:

### Research 
If you are graduate students who feels stuck at some point in your research or don't know how the field is evolving you can start a new issue and discuss with other researchers in Arabic how the field is developing. The main purpose is to brainstorm and help people who are interested in the field. 

### Industry
Many people in industry are not sure how the field is evolving and what the  new techinques in a certain part of deep learning. If you are working on a certain company, and would like to work in sentiment analysis for instance and you don't know what are the best techinques in that task, feel free to ask questions. 

### Art 
This field is not explored enough because people don't appreciate how deep learning can be used to design creative applications like drawing and calligraphy for example.  For example we used Generative models to create calligraphy and mosaics in this [repo](https://github.com/ARBML/rasm). The applications are never ending and the main purpose is to discuss how different models can be used for different applications. 

### Miscellaneous
If you are new to the field of Arabic NLP and would like to ask any question feel free to start a new issue. Mainly, we would like to focus on Arabic NLP and speech but we are also planning to extend to other fields as well. Moreover, if you are in another field and not sure how to apply different techinques in Arabic NLP or speech to your use cases feel free to ask questions. 

## Addendum 
This is not a usual repo. It is not meant to contain code. It is just a treasure for sharing and discussing new ideas and answer questions that might lead to a train of ideas that people can work on in the future. We think of research as an open space where people from different fields can discuss ideas freely.
